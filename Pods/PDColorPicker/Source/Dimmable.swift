/// Provides a simple mechanism for dimming a view controller.
///
/// The intended usage of this protocol is to allow dimming of a view controller
/// so that another view controller (e.g. an alert) may be presented on top of it.
///
/// - note:
/// Be sure to carefully read the documentation for proper use of the `dim()` and
/// `undim()` methods that are implemented by this protocol. Misuse may cause issues
/// with the view hierarchy of the view controller.

  /// with color `color` and transparency `alpha`.

  /**
   Dims the view controller that it is called on. If the view controller is inside a `UINavigationController`,
   `UITabBarController`, or both, the entire view will be dimmed including the navigation bar and tab bar.

   - warning:
     Do not add any subviews to the view controller while it is dimmed. Instead, call `undim()` on the
     view controller before adding any subviews.

   - parameters:
     - color: The tint color to be used in dimming. The default is `UIColor.black`.
     - alpha: The transparency level of the dim. A value of 0.0 means a completely transparent dim (no effect)
       whereas 1.0 is a completely opaque dim. The default value is 0.5.
     - speed: The animation speed of the dimming (in seconds). The default value is 0.5.

   Undims the view controller that it is called on. This method has no effect if the view controller
   has not been dimmed with `dim()` yet.

   - warning:
     Do not call this method unless `dim()` has been called first and the view controller has not
     been undimmed already. Calling this method when the view controller is not dimmed may cause
     issues with the view hierarchy.

   - parameters:
     - speed: The animation speed of the undimming (in seconds). The default value is 0.5.
     - completion: The completion handler that is called after the undimming is complete. Use this
       parameter to execute any cleanup or setup code that should be executed immediately after the
